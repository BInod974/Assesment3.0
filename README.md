# Assesment3.0

introduction
The proposed report presents a Python project that contains an elementary 'Pet' class that shows fundamental functions and properties of pets. I can create pet objects using this class that contain attributes for name and species together with age. The code includes functions that replicate typical pet behaviors such as maintaining the need to eat and sleep alongside playing activities. The project shows practical OOP core implementation along with software design elements to sustain a maintainable codebase that keeps scalability and ease of maintenance features.
