# Assesment3

**introduction**
The proposed report presents a Python project that contains an elementary 'Pet' class that shows fundamental functions and properties of pets. I can create pet objects using this class that contain attributes for name and species together with age. The code includes functions that replicate typical pet behaviors such as maintaining the need to eat and sleep alongside playing activities. The project shows practical OOP core implementation along with software design elements to sustain a maintainable codebase that keeps scalability and ease of maintenance features.

**Design ptinciple and concepts**
I will describe in this document how my Pet class implements the software design principlesss. The principles contribute to maintaining code that remains both easy to understand as well as reusable and simple to maintain. The following section explains how these principles apply to the code through my Pet class implementation.

 KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
The KISS principle guides my Pet class to maintain all functionality at an easy understanding level. My Pet class contains three straightforward methods that complete their individual responsibilities by feeding the pet and putting it to sleep while also checking its tiredness status. My aim to avoid code complexity worked toward creating programming streams that are readable and accessible to beginner programmers.

DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)
I made an effort to prevent the unnecessary duplication of code. The feed() method alongside play() shares identical logic to handle different pets through accessing self.name attribute of the object. The selection of writing duplicate methods for pets was avoided to make the process more efficient.

 Open/Closed Principle
The code base allows additional customization through open possibilities but it requires specific changes. I can extend the current functionality by adding new methods to the code even though existing methods stay unchanged. Although functional, the system needs improvements in its hunger logic to boost flexibility in its operations.

Composition Over Inheritance
This code has no inheritance structure it also doesn't require inheritance at present. The Combine utilitarian helper through composition after designating specific animal types (Dog and Cat).

Single Responsibility Principle
In the class definition each method performs a well-defined operation through its designated responsibility. The structure allows testers to analyze individual features without mixture with other parts of the code.

Separation of Concerns
The class only within the pet-related operations exist while it avoids all other non-pet activities such as file writing operations or database access. The code remains modular because it contains a single fundamental behavior inside each method block.

YAGNI (Your aren't gonna  need it)
I included only necessary functionality. The code does not include extra properties or methods such as health or weight measurement or energy level tracking. The code remains low in both size and length through this practice. I will implement those features at a later time if I ever require them.

Avoid Premature Optimization
During development, I ignored both efficiency and speed of execution of my code. I dedicated my work to maintain clear code that performed its essential functions correctly. The lack of performance-intensive environment makes optimization unnecessary thus following this principle.

Refactor, Refactor, Refactor
I could easily update the code in the future without difficulty due to its easy refactoring potential. The feed method requires amending by removing its input function so that the system will accept food as an argument in its place. Its adaptation into other software components would enhance testability and reuse of code.

Clean Code > Clever Code
I named my variables using clear and easy-to-understand terms including name, species, and hungry. Throughout the code I avoided complex logical approaches and excluded methods that produced obscure code. The code follows clean code principles because any reader could understand its purpose without difficulty.

**Conclusion**
The design presents a Python-based basic object-oriented class structure through effective integration of major software design principles. The Pet class maintains a simple interface that functions according to natural pet activities while showcasing clear methods for those functions. The project maintains clarity as well as future extensibility while achieving better maintainability through adherence to principles KISS, DRY and Separation of Concerns and others. The current limited functionality of the code provides a stable base for adding future advanced features in the future. The project demonstrates practical principles for writing clean Python source code which works well for educational use as well as growth-focused development needs.
